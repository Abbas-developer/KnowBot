    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?",
      "answer": "A compiler and an interpreter are both tools used in software development. A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or bytecode before execution. It checks for errors and generates an executable file or a separate output file. On the other hand, an interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line, converting it into machine code or executing it directly. It interprets and executes each statement individually, providing immediate feedback but without generating an executable file.",

    {
      "question": "What is the role of a variable in programming?",
      "answer": "In programming, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. It is used to store and manipulate data within a program. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, text, or objects, and their values can change during program execution. They enable programmers to store and retrieve data, perform calculations, make decisions, and control program flow.",

    {
      "question": "What is recursion in programming?",
      "answer": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It involves defining a base case that specifies when the function should stop calling itself and a recursive case that describes how the function calls itself with smaller input until the base case is reached. Recursion is commonly used in solving problems that exhibit a recursive structure, such as traversing hierarchical data structures or implementing algorithms like factorial or Fibonacci sequence.",

      "question": "What is an algorithm?",
      "answer": "An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules for solving a specific problem or accomplishing a particular task. It provides a clear and unambiguous description of how to perform a task or solve a problem, typically in a finite number of steps. Algorithms are used in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and everyday problem-solving.",
